# CProjects
A collection of C projects

To use, just compile and execute.

Programs:

Algorithms/ - some programs for my algorithms class

BaseConverter - converts a number from a given base to a desired base (supports bases 1 - 36)

SHA256 - computes a sha256 hash for a given string input

int_list - this is a header file which is an implementation of an integer arraylist. Functions like append, pop, delete, and random access are included

list - very similar except this implementation can hold data of any standard type (unitype union), a bit janky but works well enough

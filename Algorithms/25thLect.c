At here, Keller 120 or something i dont remember the room number

last day of class is next tuesday

Wrapping up all shortest path algorithms

What I need to study:
Graphs
Kruskal and Prim's algorithms
BFS and DFS
Bellman Ford and Dijkstra's shortest path algorithms
Floyd Warshall algorithm

Find the shortest path:
    Bellman Ford (works with directed, negative edge weights (but no negative cycles), least efficient)
    BFS (undirected only)
    Dijkstra's (works with directed, no negative edge weights)
    Astar (works with directed, no negative edge weights)
    Floyd Warshall (works with directed, negative edge weights (but no negative cycles))

Given a graph:
find S[i][j]: The shortest path from vertex i to vertex j

1. Optimisation
2. First impression - exhaustive search?
3. What is a subproblem? Do we have overlapping subproblems?
4. Can we apply dynamic programming, do we have optimal substructure?
